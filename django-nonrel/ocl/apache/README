The files in this directory are required by Apache and mod_wsgi to run this project as a WSGI application.

They are an adaptation of the instructions described here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/howto/deployment/modwsgi/

The WSGI application is defined in django.wsgi.  In deployment, it resides under the project root at:

[PROJECT_ROOT]/apache/django.wsgi

wsgi.conf is a configuration file that tells Apache where to find this WSGI application.
It should reside on the Apache host in:

[HTTPD_ROOT]/conf.d
[e.g. /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf]
